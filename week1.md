# Week 1 SGC

# Stop

### Being late

bashir: eveyrone agreed upon it already
bader: are people making sure they are catching up with the material ?
mario: tuesday and wednsday are less critical for me to atten since they are projects, and if you do miss a workshop you can just do it in the weekend

### Understanding things in theory is not enough
bader: you should ask yourselves questions about the material you were taught and put it into practice, try things.
bashir: bugs are helpful for learning too. 

### The slow internet
mario: next sunday or monday we will have the new upgrade for the internet and hopefully everythign would be fine

### Committing without fully understanding whats being commited
bader: we had some issues in our project where code just was gone from commits or resetting commits (not really sure), so be careful before commiting

### Cursing
tarek: saying it by mistake is fine, but keep repaeting it is not okay. 

# Go

### Tools
bashir: for example prettier or anything that makes our development nicer and code flow 
introduce useful tools throughout the weeks 

### Timer for each task
bashir: its for time management and planning for teams and groups, coding it's not enough.
mario and bashir explained about the pomodoro clock

### More planning at first
more planning makes for a smoother development and nicer projects

### Visible daily schedule
bashir: in my head for day 5 there was no schedule, cause i didn't see it so i felt it a bit messy today, so maybe write it on the board everyday

consensus

### More english
bashir: it's an important skill in the industry, it's the language of the internet i feel like mine is a bit rusty, so maybe while explaining code or workshops then we do it in english.

it's easier if we had an international student so he can encourage us to speak english

action point: next week start speaking more english

### Regular Coffee, decaf is a crime
we have a set amount of money now, like a kitty system, that we can take from and buy products


# Continue

### Being supportive to each other
yeah i think everyone agrees on this, we are learning here together let's support each other!

### Don't be afraid going beyond the current scope
don't be worried or be intimidated to go over something that you don't understand or go use a technology you are not sure about 

### Failure is part of the process
it's really important to understand this cause without it you can't successed

### Asking questions
sometimes as mentors we skip over things and miss things, and please stop us and ask us about everything, there is not such thing as a stupid question

### Having fun

### Communication
is key
